        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>After six years of practice as an Emergency Room Nurse in one of New York’s toughest neighborhoods, Joel noticed that his patients with mental health needs were being severely underserved in the community. These patients would end up in the hospital because of inattentive psychiatric practitioners, very long wait times, and lack of providers that accept insurance. </p>
        <p>Joel didn’t just sit around hoping the system would change...</p>

            <div>
                <p>He decided to do something about it.</p>
            <p>Three more years of schooling to become a Board Certified Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner, and four more years of clinical practice learning the art and science of functional and integrative psychiatry - Joel has a loyal following for a reason:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>No unnecessary and dangerous medication combinations that don’t clinically make sense.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>No throwing medications at patients as bandaid therapies without treating the underlying core issues.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>No rushing a patient out the door without being fully evaluated and understood.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Rather...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Clinically sound medication regimens using the lowest effective doses that help symptoms while decreasing side effects.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Supportive guidance and insight therapy along with medications (if needed) to help patients heal from the core.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>All treatment plan rationales are fully explained to the patient and agreed upon by both parties.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Patients collaborate with Joel - No one is told to just take this therapy because “I said so”.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Enjoyable sessions. That’s right, Joel’s patients actually look forward to their sessions. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Accepts most Insurances and for the few that aren’t, private pay rates are very reasonable.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We're looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

            <h2>What patients are saying...</h2>
        <p>“Becoming a patient of Joel’s practice has, without question, improved my life immensely. I was depressed and anxious before seeing him and barely able to make eye contact even with friends. Just one month later, I am holding longer conversations and feel the desire to connect with others which I haven’t felt in so long. Thank you so much, Dr. Joel!”<br> <span>-Melissa V.</span></p>
        <hr>
        <p>“I came to Joel on 4 different medications that my previous psychiatrist put me on. Joel did a thorough workup and started a treatment plan that would taper and discontinue all but one of the medications I was on, and added a low dose of a new one that has been great. I feel like a new person now without my head foggy all day. He addressed with me the problems I was experiencing in my life and helped me work through a lot of issues. Because I am now clear headed, I was able to make these positive changes that were contributing to my depression and ADHD and I am slowly taking my life back. I am forever grateful.”<br><span>-Dave P.</span></p>
